The objective of this application is to use javascript to create a configurable password generator that does the following
    *Allows users to select the number of characters between 8-128
    
    *Allow users to select which kinds of characters they would like the password to contain (Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols/special characters)

    *Uses built in browser prompts that allows the user to configure it as they please

The way it SHOULD work is as follows
    *On clicking the "generate password" button a function is ran that will generate all the prompts for the user to state the parameters of their generated password

    *These parameters then are then ran through another function to weed out any that were not selected.
    
    *Run the rest through a loop to generate a random arangement of the characters selected and then output it to the box
